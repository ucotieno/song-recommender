## Tech Stack

- **Database:** SQLite
- **Backend:** FastAPI
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Deployment:** Render

## Machine Learning Components

### Recommendation
- Recommend 10 similar songs using **K-Nearest Neighbors** with **cosine similarity**.

### Popularity Prediction
- Predict a song's popularity score using the better-performing model between:
